		<li>
			Remove the first element \(d_1\) of \(S_0\) and subtract 1 from the next \(d_1\) elements, <!-- , if possible, -->

				<!-- before --> sorting the remaining elements to form a non-increasing 
				<a aria-describedby="footnote-label" href="#fn-zeros" id="fn-zeros-ref">sequence</a> \(S_1\). 
				If this is not possible (there are fewer than \(d_1\) terms in the truncated sequence) or \(S_1\)
				contains a negative integer, \(S_1\), and therefore \(S_0\), is non-graphic. 
				<!-- As zeros are of no -->
				<!-- consequence as to whether a sequence is graphic (unconnected vertices), it is convenient to -->
				<!-- remove all such terms from \(S_1\). -->

		<li>
			<!-- Repeat with the first element of \(S_1\) to generate \(S_2\) and then \(S_3,S_4,\ldots\). -->
			Repeat to generate \(S_2,S_3,\ldots\). If at any stage there are too few terms to subtract 1 from,
			or a non-negative integer is encountered, the original sequence is non-graphic.
			Otherwise, after at most \(n-1\) steps, a sequence \(S_F\) of zeros will result.
			 <!-- As \(S_F\) is clearly graphic (a collection of unconnected vertices), so is \(S_0\). -->
			 As \(S_F\) clearly has a graphical representation (a collection of 1 or more unconnected vertices), so does \(S_0\).
			<!-- sequence of the form \(S_F=(1,1,0,\ldots,0)\) will result. As \(S_F\) is clearly graphic, so is \(S_0\). -->

			Graphically, in the \(i^{\text{th}}\) iteration we attach
			the vertex with the greatest degree \(d(v_{\text{max}})\) to the \(d(v_{\text{max}})\) vertices of
